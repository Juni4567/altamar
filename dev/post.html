                      <p>US President Donald Trump has told supporters that his proposed wall along the border with Mexico could have solar panels fixed to it. Addressing a rally in Iowa, he said the panels would provide cheap energy and help to pay for the controversial wall. He suggested the plan was his own, saying: "Pretty good imagination, right? Good? My idea." However, solar panels have been included in designs for the wall submitted by companies. During his campaign, Mr Trump pledged to build a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He insisted he would make Mexico foot the bill, but President Enrique Peña Nieto has dismissed the idea.</p>

                      <p>Mr Trump told cheering supporters at a campaign-style rally in Cedar Rapids on Wednesday that he would "give you an idea that nobody has heard about yet". "We're thinking of something that's unique, we're talking about the southern border, lots of sun, lots of heat. We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall, so it creates energy and pays for itself. And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money, and that's good, right?" </p>

                      <p>He added: "Solar wall, panels, beautiful. I mean actually think of it, the higher it goes the more valuable it is. Pretty good imagination right? Good? My idea." More than 200 companies have reportedly responded to an invitation from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to submit designs for the wall. Among them was one from Gleason Partners in Las Vegas that proposed a wall of steel, cement and solar panels.
                      In April, US media reported that President Trump had raised the idea with Republican Congressional leaders in talks at the White House.
                      Two academics also suggested the idea of a solar panelled wall in an article for the Wall Street Journal in March.</p>

                      <h4>Indictment and trial</h4>
                      
                      <p>What Mr Starr decided not to do with his investigation was seek a criminal indictment of the president. But while conventional wisdom is that this option is foreclosed, there are some differing views in the legal community. While the constitution is clear about impeachment proceedings, it's silent on the subject of bringing criminal charges against a sitting president.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>Those who think a presidential indictment is impossible tend to point to the impracticality of indicting someone who has the legal authority to pardon himself, as well as a passage in the constitution that states removal from office through impeachment doesn't preclude criminal charges.
                      That suggests, they say, the founding fathers envisioned any criminal proceedings should only take place after a president is out of power.</p>
                      
                      <p>"It is an open and substantial question whether an incumbent president is subject to indictment," Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski told Supreme Court justices when they were considering whether to grant a subpoena for President Richard Nixon's Oval Office tape recordings.
                      Mr Nixon resigned before he was impeached and was subsequently pardoned by President Gerald Ford, but the special prosecutor had named him an "unindicted co-conspirator" in its case against several of the president's aides.</p>
                      <img class="full-width margin-small" src="images/post-image2.jpg" alt="">

                      <p>Giving the judiciary the ability to sanction a sitting president also could implicate the constitutionally crafted separation of powers between the three divisions of US government - the executive, the legislative and the judicial. Judges are in the branch the least accountable to US voters, the argument goes, which is why the founding fathers put the power of removal in the hands of Congress, with members who have an electoral mandate.</p>
                      
                      <p>Susan Bloch, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University who has studied the legality of presidential indictments, says the prospect of a president standing trial and then possibly being sentenced to jail while still technically in office is "ludicrous".</p>

                      <p>"You should not be subjecting a president to a criminal procedure while he's president," she says. "The text [of the Constitution] suggests it, but I think the practical considerations to me say you don't want to make a president worry about a criminal proceeding."</p>

                      <p>While the US Supreme Court held that a sitting president could be subjected to a civil trial in Jones v Clinton - the sexual harassment case brought by against President Clinton that eventually led to his impeachment - the penalties in such cases are monetary, not possible jail time.</p>

                      <h4>An indictment on hold</h4>
                      <p>A third possible resolution was floated in that Office of Legal Counsel memo, although the Justice Department ultimately rejected it. Could a grand jury issue a presidential indictment, then put the trial on hold until after the chief executive leaves office?</p>

                      <p>That would certainly avoid the spectacle of a sitting president in the criminal dock, but it would allow the wheels of justice to begin turning. The Justice Department's view, however, was that the resulting political cloud would surely be toxic.</p>

                      <p>Given "the realities of modern politics and mass media, and the delicacy of the political relationships which surround the presidency both foreign and domestic," the Justice Department wrote in its 1973 report, there would "be a Russian roulette aspect to the course of indicting the president but postponing trial, hoping in the meantime that the power to govern could survive".</p>

                      <p>Even someone as apparently bulletproof as Mr Trump would be hard-pressed to survive such a spectacle.</p>

                      <p>It wouldn't take long for Mr Trump's opponents, for instance, to dust off old quotes from the Republican's presidential campaign in which he warned of the dire prospects of Hillary Clinton assuming the presidency while the target of a criminal probe.</p>

                      <p>They would certainly appreciate the irony, bitter though it may be.</p>
